# Implementation-of-NJ-using-CUDA 
This is  the repo for the cs6024 course project, we will start writing code and create pull requests whenever we want to push the code with some testcases so that Github will only check the correctness of code and we won't have to do labour job.
For doing any changes other than contributers do fork the repo.
